# Reuben's Website

Built using HTML, CSS, and JS. Keeping Responsive Design principles in mind in whatever I design within this website.

To-Do
1. Find methods to minify website on deployment for better web-performance
2. Randomize constellations to easily fill screen size no matter what
3. Add a Phaser 3 game for funsies
4. Give proper attributions where needed... in this README?
5. create a consistent design across web-pages

Have-Done (As of December 2020)
1. Much needed refactor. HTML and CSS is in a much more stable spot.
2. updated visuals with new splashname and background gradient.
